## What is an algorithm?
`A step by step description of how to solve a given problem.`

## What is an algorithm?

`It's the steps needed to solve a problem,
not how to solve the problem using Javascript (or any other programming language)!` - Onwaba

## Taxi Kata
pseudo code!  
what should be done in words...

## Flow chart for Taxi Kata - Take 1

* Start
* Initialise the counter
* Check which arrow was key pressed on keyboard
* If the right arrow key was pressed increment the counter
* If the left arrow key was pressed decrement the counter
* Calculate the Taxi Class name from the counter
* Assign the className to the taxi
